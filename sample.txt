S
ANALYSIS QUESTIONS

When I am done with wrangling the 3 files and merged them in the finale 
DataFrame
I asked myself what do I want 
to know from this data and what came to my mind as follows:
1.
What is
the
most
used
name
for
dogs
in
this
period?
2.
Is there
a
relation
between favorite
count
and
retweet
count?
3.
What is
the
most
favorited
breed per year?
4.
What is
the
most
used
source
over
the
period
to
direct
any
future

-

5.
How many
tweets
per
day
get a high rating.
WHAT IS THE MOST USED NAME
I am using Tableau within this project and to answer this question I created a word cloud and it turns out that the top 3 

are
male names and for female name the top 2 are Sadie and 
lucy
.
WHAT IS THE MOST USED NAME
IS THERE A RELATION BETWEEN FAVORITE COUNT AND RETWEET 
COUNT

For this part I did create
a
viz on tableau that show a good relation between both also I have added some elements 
and the description of this viz is as follows:
1.
Average of Favorite Count vs. average of Retweet Count. Color shows details about Dog Stage. Size shows details about Source.
Th
e marks are labeled by Breed 
and Dog Stage. The view is filtered on Breed and Exclusions (
Breed,Dog
Stage,Source
). The Breed filter keeps 81 of 78 members. The Exclusions (
Breed,Dog
Stage,Source
) filter keeps 188 members.

Also:
Rows:
Avg. Retweet Count
Columns:
Avg. Favorite Count
Filters:
Breed, Exclusions (
Breed,Dog
Stage,Source

IS THERE A RELATION BETWEEN FAVORITE COUNT AND RETWEET 
COUNT
WHAT IS THE MOST FAVORITED BREED PER YEAR?
WHAT IS THE MOST FAVORITED BREED PER YEAR?

Count of Favorite Count for each Breed broken down by Timestamp Year. Color shows count of Favorite Count. The data is filter
ed 
on 
Timestamp Year, which ranges from 2015 to 2017
1.
For 2015 it is chihuahua with 35 records 
2.
For 2016
it
is
golden
retriever
with
78
records
3.
For 2017 it is golden retriever with 31 records
Its
seems
that
retrievers
are
the
most
like
d
breed

them

WHAT IS THE MOST USED SOURCE OVER THE PERIOD TO DIRECT ANY

For this one I used a simple 
pyplot
function to get the frequency using a histogram:

And it
seems
twitter
for
iphone
got
it
all
also I noticed that there is no twitter deck for 2017 but not showing in this 
viz.
HOW MANY TWEETS PER DAY GET A HIGH RATING.

It will be useful to know how many tweets getting  a high rating per day and check those 
urls
to know why they have a 
higher rating and other not but for clarity I did the viz by quarter/month. And the average about
10.58
.
HOW MANY TWEETS PER DAY GET A HIGH RATING.

Rating Numerator for each Timestamp Month broken down by Timestamp Year and Timestamp Quarter. The data is 
filtered on maximum of Breed, which excludes None.
